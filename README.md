# M5531 Series CMSIS BSP

To experience the powerful features of M5531 series in few minutes, please select the sample code to download and execute on the NuMaker-M5531 board. Open the project files to build them with Keil® MDK, IAR, NuEclipse or VS Code, and then download and trace them on the NuMaker board to see how it works.

Please note that M5531 Series CMSIS BSP enables CPU Level-1 I/D-Cache by default but does not guarantee Cache coherence.

	Helper functions of communication protocols, e.g., XMODEM.

- CryptoAccelerator<br>
	Crypto accelerator source code for mbedtls.

- Device<br>
	CMSIS compliant device header files.

- JpegAcceleratorLib<br>
	SIMD accelerator library binary and header files for libjpeg.

- PowerDeliveryLib<br>
	Power delivery library binary and header files for dual, source and sink role.

- SmartcardLib<br>
	Smart card library binary and header files.

- StdDriver<br>

## .\Sample Code\

- CortexM55<br>
	Cortex®-M55 sample code.

- Crypto<br>
	Crypto sample code using Mbed TLS library.

- FreeRTOS<br>
	Simple FreeRTOS™ demo code.
	
- Hard\_Fault\_Sample<br>
	Show hard fault information when hard fault happened.<p>
	The hard fault handler shows some information including program counter, which is the address where the processor is executed when the hard fault occurs. The listing file (or map file) can show what function and instruction that is.<p>
	It also shows the Link Register (LR), which contains the return address of the last function call. It can show the status where CPU comes from to get to this point.

- ISP<br>
	Sample code for In-System-Programming.

- NuMaker-M5531<br>
	Sample code for NuMaker-M5531 board.

- PowerDelivery<br>
	Sample code for power delivery on UTCPD board.

- PowerManagement<br>
	Sample code for power management.

- SecureApplication<br>
	Sample code for secure application.<p>
	VS Code projects require Python 3.12 at least for post-build.

- Semihost<br>
	Show how to print and get character through IDE console window.

- StdDriver<br>
	Sample code to demonstrate the usage of M5531 series MCU peripheral driver APIs.

- Template<br>
	Project template for M5531 series MCU.

- TrustZone<br>
	Demo of secure code and non-secure code.

- XOM<br>
