# M5531 Series CMSIS BSP

To experience the powerful features of M5531 series in few minutes, please select the sample code to download and execute on the NuMaker-M5531 board. Open the project files to build them with Keil® MDK, IAR, NuEclipse or VS Code, and then download and trace them on the NuMaker board to see how it works.

Please note that M5531 Series CMSIS BSP enables CPU Level-1 I/D-Cache by default but does not guarantee Cache coherence.


## .\Document\

## .\Library\

- CMSIS<br>
	Cortex® Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) V6.1.0 definitions by Arm® Corp.<p>
	M5531 CMSIS-Drivers do not guarantee thread safety and Cache coherence. The source and RTE_Device header files are in the "Driver\Source" sub-folder. Please add source files and copy RTE_Device header files into your project. Projects can define PRJ_RTE_DEVICE_HEADER macro to include the private RTE_Device.h.

- Commu<br>
	Helper functions of communication protocols, e.g., XMODEM.

- CryptoAccelerator<br>
	Crypto accelerator source code for mbedtls.

- Device<br>
	CMSIS compliant device header files.

- JpegAcceleratorLib<br>
	SIMD accelerator library binary and header files for libjpeg.

- PowerDeliveryLib<br>
	Power delivery library binary and header files for dual, source and sink role.

- SmartcardLib<br>
	Smart card library binary and header files.

- StdDriver<br>
	All peripheral driver header and source files.

- Storage<br>
	Disk I/O modules for FatFs.

- UsbHostLib<br>
	USB host library source code.


## .\Sample Code\

- CortexM55<br>
	Cortex®-M55 sample code.

- Crypto<br>
	Crypto sample code using Mbed TLS library.

- FreeRTOS<br>
	Simple FreeRTOS™ demo code.
	
- Hard\_Fault\_Sample<br>
	Show hard fault information when hard fault happened.<p>
	The hard fault handler shows some information including program counter, which is the address where the processor is executed when the hard fault occurs. The listing file (or map file) can show what function and instruction that is.<p>
	It also shows the Link Register (LR), which contains the return address of the last function call. It can show the status where CPU comes from to get to this point.

- ISP<br>
	Sample code for In-System-Programming.

- NuMaker-M5531<br>
	Sample code for NuMaker-M5531 board.

- PowerDelivery<br>
	Sample code for power delivery on UTCPD board.

- PowerManagement<br>
	Sample code for power management.

- SecureApplication<br>
	Sample code for secure application.<p>
	VS Code projects require Python 3.12 at least for post-build.

- Semihost<br>
	Show how to print and get character through IDE console window.

- StdDriver<br>
	Sample code to demonstrate the usage of M5531 series MCU peripheral driver APIs.

- Template<br>
	Project template for M5531 series MCU.

- TrustZone<br>
	Demo of secure code and non-secure code.

- XOM<br>
	Demonstrate how to create XOM library and use it.

- lwIP<br>
	A widely used open source TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems.

- mbedtls<br>
	Mbed TLS offers an SSL library with an intuitive API and readable source code, so you can actually understand what the code does.

- openmv<br>
	An open-source, low-cost machine vision platform. It supports image processing functions such as face detection, key-pointes descriptions, color tracking, QR and Bar code decoding and more.<p>
