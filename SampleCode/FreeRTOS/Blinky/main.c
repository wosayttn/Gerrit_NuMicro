/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.  It also contains a dummy
 * interrupt service routine called Dummy_IRQHandler() that is provided as an
 * example of how to use interrupt safe FreeRTOS API functions (those that end
 * in "FromISR").

    demo application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the

    FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
    specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
    vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
    important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling

    functions can be used (those that end in FromISR()).  The code in this
